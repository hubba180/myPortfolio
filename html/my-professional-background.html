        <h4 class="panel panel-heading">Marzamemi Maritime Heritage Project</h2>
        <p><strong>Position:</strong> Nautical Archaeologist</p>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong>This project, run as a conjoined effort by the Institute of Nautical Archaeology, Stanford, and Brock Universities, excavated the wreck site of a late antique roman merchant ship carrying a massive amount of prefabricated marble as well as pigments and amphorae from various regions. The site is located off the southeast coast of Sicily. My job as a trench supervisor was to oversee excavation in assigned sections, train new students, assemble and manoeuvre site dredges, set up site grid systems and datums, raise then conserve artifacts via desalination/electrolytic reduction then arrange and document long term storage, site documentation through photogrammetry, create 3D models via Artec, survey surrounding regions, and make occasional inputs into ArcGIS. Additionally, I participated in exhibit design and build for the local Rudini Museum and set up project PR outreach events and exhibits within the local Marzamemi township.</p>

        <h4 class="panel panel-heading">U.S. Forest Service</h2>
        <p><strong>Position:</strong> Archaeological Technician</p>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong>Archaeological field research carried out across the state though my primary objective was to continue survey work on the Castle Mountains Restoration Project (now finalized and moving forward with controlled burns to lower risk of unmanageable forest fires) in compliance with section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act. The surveys I conducted insured that these fires would not damage newly found or previously managed heritage sites. Skills needed to conduct such surveys included being proficient in back-country navigation, ArcGIS, Lidar, aerial photography analysis, coordinating team transects, and conducting shovel test pits. Once a site was found, site features and artifacts were recorded, mapped, and photographed then logged into the national register. For each site, an environmental impact statement was made to assess possible damages of a controlled burn.</p>
